# TrafficProject

Simulate the time it takes to get from home to work
-Time it takes from home to bus stop
-From bus stop to train station
-From train station to metro
-Metro to work

Train stations and origin points will be modeled as an infinite server queue
Both have people waiting until they are picked up at a set time

Both will be simulated with a normal distribution
